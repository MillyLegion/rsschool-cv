3. I started as *backend developer* in c++ by solving algorithmic tasks and GUI on MIcrosoft Visual Studio. Later I got interested in machine learning and started learning python, as it has all ready to go libraries, frameworks and platforms. I really got inspired by AI and its capabilities, so I have started learning all necessary skills like Theory of Probabilty, discrete mathematics and necessary algorithms. In this juncture I worked at Workly as a junior Golang developer, but later quit this job, as I had no growth. As for now I'm mainly focused on becoming Fullstack developer and passive occupied with bot cretion on teelgram and nlp. I always strive for new skills and learning in all aspects of my life, cause self education is the core skill in this era of chaotic improvements.<br>

7. I have been working with algorithms and machine learning quite a while, and have passed many courses on [stepik](https://stepik.org/) and [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Particularly, Andrew Ng course on coursera about basics of machine learning and nlp, python, inntroduction to DB, graph theory and object modeling courses on stepik. For now I'm studying at TUIT. Also, I have an IELTs certificate with 5.5 total score, that I acquired 3 years ago. That really helps me to get to know more by reading more artciles and official documentation on english.
